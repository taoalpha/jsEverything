## jsEverything

JS is my primary language and I believe it is the best language from my point of view: it is the best language to implement both functional programming and object oriented programming. So I build this repo to record all those scripts that I wrote during the learning and practicing.

The scripts will be divided into different categories:

- Data Structures: since javascript has only six primitive types and one complex object represents everything else, it doesn't have so many powerful data structures like java and other languages, so I will try to implement all these frequently used data structures like queue, stack and tree ...etc.
- Algorithms: like sorting, searching, dfs, bfs, kmp ...etc.
- Modules rewrote: I will rewrite some modules to practice, most of the modules will be from [npmjs](npmjs.org), I will start from easy ones.

By doing all these stuffs, I hope I can keep learning and improving my javascript skills, and in order to get familiar with ES6 and also fit for future, I will use ES6 as my first choice, and I will try my best to be compatible with ES5.


Currently have:

- Data Structures:
    1. caseless dictionary: from [Caseless object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caseless), add symbol support, remove the httpify.
- Algorithms:
    1. sorting algorithms (insertion, selection, bubble, merge, quick, bucket, radix, heap, counting)
- Modules:
    1. colors
    2. notif-logger
